# Introduction
Welcome to the "SZUtils" repository! This is a collection of various tools and utilities that I've developed over time to make my coding, studying, work, and personal life easier. Inside this repository, you'll find a variety of code snippets, scripts, and applications that are designed to save time, increase productivity, and solve common problems.

Some of the tools included in this repository are:
- Script utilities for automating repetitive tasks
- Code snippets for commonly used functions and algorithms
- Configuration files for setting up development environments
- Utilities for data analysis and visualization
- Tools for managing personal finances and household tasks
I hope you find these utilities useful and that they help you in your own work and life. Feel free to use, modify, and contribute to this repository as you see fit. Happy coding!
